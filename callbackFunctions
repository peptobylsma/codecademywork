const checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes = () => {
  for(let i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if ( (2 + 2) != 4) {
      console.log('Something has gone very wrong :( ');
    }
  }
};

const addTwo = num => num + 2;

const timeFuncRuntime = funcParameter => {
  let t1 = Date.now();
  funcParameter();
  let t2 = Date.now();
  return t2 - t1;
};

console.log(timeFuncRuntime(addTwo))

// Write your code below (this is our starting point)

let time2p2 = timeFuncRuntime(checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes);

const checkConsistentOutput = (functionOne, value) => {
  let checkOne = functionOne(value); 
  let checkTwo = functionOne(value);
  if  (checkOne === checkTwo){
    return checkOne;
  } else {
    return 'This function returned inconsistent results'
  }
}

console.log(checkConsistentOutput(addTwo, 5)); // prints 7

Below is the stepwise process that will hopefully help you follow whats happening througout the execution of this code once we have invoked checkConsistentOutput();.
1) First, we invoke the checkConsistentOutput that we created above and pass addTwo and 5 into that function as checkConsistentOutput(addTwo, 5);.
  
  - Since we are invoking the function, it is going to run all of the code inside of its code block with the parameters we've asked it to use.
  - Remember that we do NOT put parenthesis at the end of the function name when we are passing a function as a parameter.
  - the addTwo() function is kind of hidden up further in the code, that's how we knew what that function was going to do.
  
2) Function becomes
  
        checkConsistentOutput = (addTwo, 5) => {
3)      let checkOne = addTwo(5); // assignment of addTwo(5) to the checkOne variable within the checkConsistentOutput function, which would return 5 = 5 + 2. --> 7
4)      let checkTwo = addTwo(5); // assignment of addTwo(5) to the checkTwo variable within the checkConsistentOutput function, which would return 5 = 5 + 2. --> 7
5)      if  (checkOne === checkTwo){ // checks that the two variables (which we assigned our "inner functions" to) are equal to each other.
        return checkOne; // checkOne is returned because the "if" condition is satisfied since checkOne === checkTwo
      } else {
6)        return 'This function returned inconsistent results' // this does not happen because the "if" condition was satisfied.
  }

 
 I think a lot of confusion stemmed from nomenclature and syntax issues on top of an already somewhat complicated subject. 
 It was especially hard (for me at least) to try and follow the functions and variables around the code block and visualize what was actually happening as the code ran.
 Hopefully, this will help some get a better understanding. If you're frustrated, it's okay - this drove me nuts for several days before I was finally able to wrap
 my head around it.
 
 - Cheers! 

 
  




Practice from YT Video.

/*let calc = function(num1, num2, calcType){
  if(calcType === 'add'){
    return num1 + num2;
  } else if (calcType === 'multiply'){
    return num1 * num2;
  } else {
    console.log('error');
  }
}

console.log(calc(4 , 3, 'add'));*/

let add = function(a,b){
  return a + b;
}; // creation of the add function

let multiply = function(a, b){
  return a * b;
}; // creation of the multiply function

const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
} // creation of the divide function

let error = () => {
  return 'error';
} // random return error function to help drive the point home.

let calc = function(num1, num2, callbackFunction){
  return  callbackFunction(num1, num2);
} // creation of the calc function
console.log(calc(4,3, multiply)) //invoke calc function with 4, 3, and divide as arguments.

/*so I believe the AHA moment here is that in our calc function, the one we ultimately want to call to do the thing we want to do, takes one of the above functions as an 
argument and RUNS THAT FUNCTION while the calc function itself runs. You could put any of the above function names without parenthesis in the "callbackFunction" position
of calc(a, b, callbackFunction) and it will perform the action of that function.
