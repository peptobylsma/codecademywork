/* 
The if statement that pushes data into the mutualFollowers array is still part of the inner for loop, so it will run any time the outer loop iterates. 
Aha moment - the inner loop runs COMPLETELY for each singular outer loop iteration. So we are comparing i = 0 to j = 0, j = 1, j = 2.

i = 0 ('a')
 ~ j = 0, stop condition not met, code runs and will iterate.
  ~ if statement runs within the inner for loop
    ~ THE VALUE at i = 0 and j = 0 are both 'a'. There is a match, so this is pushed into the mutualFollowers array. The value at j = 1 and j = 2 do not match the value at i = 0, so they are not pushed into the mutualFollowers array.

i = 1 ('b')
if statement runs, the value at i = i (which is 'b') does not match any iterations of j=0 thru j=2. No data printed to the mutualFollowers array.

i = 2 ('c')
if statement runs. the value is i = 2 (which is 'c'). i = 2 matches the iteration at j = 2 in the inner loop. 'c' is pushed to the mutualFollowers array.
